# Random Password Generator

## Description

This project was created to allow users to create completely randomized passwords for maximum security. When you create an entirely randomized password, especially one with many characters, it makes it that much more difficult for hackers to access your accounts.

During this project, I learned a ton about JavaScript in general. Specifically, I learned a lot about how for loops worked, how to use Math.floor() and Math.random(), and how to call functions. Additionally, this project gave me great experience in thinking through a problem from start to finish. When using JavaScript, you have to think about every single step of the process, and this helped me with that mindset.
